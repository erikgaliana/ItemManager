<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Users could have access to Item Manager where they can search items given the following criteria:

- Title
- Description
- Price
- Email

Each item will have these fields and a picture.

When they perform a search that has results, they are going to find a list of the items showing all the information. Users can sort the listed items by title, description, price or email.
Also, they can acces to a favourite items list, so they can select the items from the list and save them on their favourite list. The list is displayed on a modal containing all those items showing only the picture and the title. The modal is opened opened by clicking on a button displayed at the bottom on the page where itâ€™s easily accessible.
In the favourite modal, Users can search by title and they have the possibility to remove the items from the favourite list without having to close the modal. The list won't be preserved when they refresh the page.
